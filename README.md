## What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo
Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo
  Workflows on Kubernetes.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) hosted project.

## Use Cases

* Machine Learning pipelines
* Data and batch processing
* ETL
* Infrastructure automation
* CI/CD

## Why Argo Workflows?

* Argo Workflows is the most popular workflow execution engine for Kubernetes.
* It can run 1000s of workflows a day, each with 1000s of concurrent tasks.
* Our users say it is lighter-weight, faster, more powerful, and easier to use
* Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based
  environments.
* Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
